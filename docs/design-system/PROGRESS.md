# LAC Design Lab progress

## Current phase

**Nocturne / Batch 3 — Data display and carousels.** Tactile remains Design 01 and is preserved. Nocturne now has reusable action, form, disclosure, feedback, data-display and carousel modules.

## Completed

- Safe baseline: `04f81eb`.
- Audit, architecture and initial system documentation: `f319069`.
- Clean lint baseline: `ccd2df3`.
- Semantic foundation tokens with `--neo-*` compatibility: `516b803`.
- Typed five-design registry, client provider, guarded local preference persistence, global design selector and Nocturne presentation layer: `f38473c`.
- Independent Nocturne component tree, typography, action, card, input, accordion, overlay, effects and motion studies: `bf519c3`.
- Reusable Nocturne actions and form controls, integrated in interactive Lab studies: `2310fec`.
- Reusable Nocturne disclosure and feedback components, including Hover Card, integrated in two interactive Lab studies: `213dcf6`, `f484d3c`.
- Reusable Nocturne cards, display primitives, sortable/paginated table and manual carousel variants: `7b8453c`.

## Current coverage

| 02 Nocturne | In development | Separate Lab presentation; actions, forms, disclosure, feedback, data display and carousel modules; overlay, type, motion and effects studies. |
| 03 Editorial | Registered | No visual recipe yet. |
| 04 Brutalist | Registered | No visual recipe yet. |
| 05 Playground | Registered | No visual recipe yet. |

Latest verified implementation commit: `7b8453cd0b8eaff4e2246b626ea7753cb333e81f`.

## Known issues / deferred checks

- Built preview is available at `http://127.0.0.1:4175`; visual approval remains owner work.
- Browser keyboard, responsive and screen-reader QA remain deferred.
- Nocturne dialog has semantic dialog markup and dismissal controls, but focus trap / restoration is still deferred.
- Copy uses the browser clipboard when available; fallback feedback is visual only.
- Comprehensive responsive, assistive-technology and focus-management QA is deferred until the Nocturne library is complete.
- The root `effects-interaction.css` is an untracked, unused duplicate and remains intentionally untouched.

## Exact next step

Continue Nocturne Batch 4: extract overlays and advanced interactions, including focus management and keyboard behavior.
